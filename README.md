# brackets-html-starter
Brackets extension to easily insert an html starter template

## How to use
It's super easy. At the beginning of your new file when you start typing the opening html tag **<html\>**, a hint will appear with "**html...**" You can either click the hint or simply press TAB or press ENTER and the html starter code will be placed in your file

If you don't want the starter, you can just continue typing and can expect the normal behaviour i.e. (the normal html hint etc.)
